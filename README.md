# Jadeite â€” an Erlang implementation of Jade-like language

[Jade][jade] is a template engine heavily influenced by [Haml][haml]
and implemented with JavaScript for [node.js][nodejs].

Jadeite is implementation of Jade-like template engine in Erlang.

## Status

The project is in pre-alpha status. While the task to create is somehow
ambitious, the state of things is, that there's nothing to see yet.

Although, [Neotoma][neotoma]-generated parser seem to work and
`jadeite_parse:parse/1` yields us an AST:

    1> jadeite_parse:parse("html\n    head\n        title This is a test\n").
    [{tag,"html"},
     {indent,4},
     {tag,"head"},
     {indent,8},
     {tag,"title"},
     {text," This is a test"},
     {newline,"\n"}]

As this is a hobby project, the development is irregular and may stall
for quite a long time.

## Limitations and differences

Major:

  - Neotoma 1.4 fails on non-ASCII input because of erlang's `re` module
    deficiency.

Minor:

  - A newline is required at the end of file.
